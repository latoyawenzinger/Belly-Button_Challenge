# Belly-Button-Challenge



In the human belly button, there are microbes that live inside it. In this data, there were some microbial species that were found in more than 70% of people, while other species proved to be relatively rare. This dataset refers to each microbial species as **"Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)"**. 

In this interactive dashboard, the user can view the data of individual of their choosing. 

- There is a dropdown element that holds all of the patient IDs in this dataset. The user can pick any ID of their choosing.

- A bubble chart will show the relationship between OTU size and value. The size of the bubble represents the value of the OTU. Each color represents an OTU ID. And on hover, the user can see the OTU ID and Label
